  # DATABASE DESIGN:
  
   To design the database, we have taken into consideration two popular models. One is the Entity-Relationship model, and the other is the Relational Model. ER Diagram allows us to view all the entities in brief and relationships between them. The relational Diagram allows us to view the entity as a relation (or a table) thus decribing each and every attribute along with their respective data types.
